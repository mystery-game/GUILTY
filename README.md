# GUILTY - Detective Mystery Game

ðŸŽ® **A strategic detective mystery game requiring logical deduction over multiple rounds**

> **IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE AI DEVELOPMENT:** This README contains ALL necessary context for maintaining and enhancing this game. Read this document completely before making any changes to preserve the intended design philosophy and user experience.

## Design Philosophy & Core Requirements

### **PRIMARY GOAL: THINKING GAME, NOT GUESSING GAME**
GUILTY is designed as a **logic puzzle** that requires **systematic analysis** over **multiple elimination rounds**. Success must come from **careful deduction**, not lucky guesses.

### **MANDATORY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**
1. **Minimal Starting Information** - Game MUST start with only 1 clue
2. **Progressive Revelation** - New clues earned ONLY through perfect elimination rounds
3. **3+ Round Minimum** - Game MUST require at least 3 rounds of logical deduction
4. **No Guessing Shortcuts** - Players cannot win by random suspect selection
5. **Mistake Recovery** - Players MUST be able to correct exoneration errors
6. **Visual Clarity** - Game state and next actions MUST be immediately clear

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (minimal server for static hosting)
- **Deployment:** Static hosting compatible (Render, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- **Dependencies:** express@^4.18.2 ONLY

## Game Logic Implementation

### **Core Game State Structure:**
```javascript
gameState = {
    difficulty: 'easy|medium|hard',
    suspects: Array[16],           // Always exactly 16 suspects
    culprit: Object,              // One randomly selected suspect
    cluesRevealed: Array,         // Progressive clue accumulation
    startTime: Number,            // For timer functionality
    gameActive: Boolean,          // Game session control
    eliminationRound: Number,     // Current round (starts at 1)
    phase: 'elimination'          // Always elimination-based
}
```

### **Suspect Object Structure:**
```javascript
suspect = {
    id: Number,                   // 0-15 unique identifier
    name: String,                 // From SUSPECT_NAMES array
    job: String,                  // From JOBS array
    traits: {                     // 5 required trait categories
        access: String,           // 5-level progression
        timing: String,           // 5-level progression  
        knowledge: String,        // 5-level progression
        motive: String,           // 5-level progression
        behavior: String          // 5-level progression
    },
    exonerated: Boolean,          // Player action state
    shouldExonerate: Boolean      // Logic calculation result
}
```

### **Trait Progression System (IMMUTABLE):**
```javascript
TRAIT_PROGRESSIONS = {
    access: ['None', 'Visitor', 'Contractor', 'Staff', 'VIP'],
    timing: ['Asleep', 'Working', 'Home', 'Out', 'Verified'],
    knowledge: ['None', 'Basic', 'Limited', 'Familiar', 'Expert'],
    motive: ['None', 'Curious', 'Vengeful', 'Greedy', 'Desperate'],
    behavior: ['Helpful', 'Normal', 'Changed', 'Nervous', 'Suspicious']
}
```

### **Difficulty Logic (EXACT SPECIFICATIONS):**

#### **Initial Clues:**
- **ALL difficulties:** Start with exactly **1 clue** (NEVER more)
- **Rationale:** Forces strategic multi-round gameplay

#### **Trait Matching Rules:**
- **Easy:** Exact match OR Â±1 position distance (yellow zone)
- **Medium:** Exact match OR Â±1 position distance (yellow zone)  
- **Hard:** ONLY exact matches (no yellow zone)

#### **Edge Case Handling:**
- Traits at position 0 or 4 have limited yellow zones
- Yellow highlighting MUST respect progression boundaries
- Distance calculation: `Math.abs(index1 - index2)`

## UI/UX Requirements

### **Exoneration System (CRITICAL):**
- **NEVER hide exonerated suspects** - they must remain visible
- Exonerated suspects: 40% opacity, grayscale filter, muted colors
- **Green "Un-Exonerate" button** for mistake correction
- **Yellow highlighting** for suspects that should be exonerated
- **Smart feedback** on Check Exonerations button

### **Visual States:**
```css
.suspect-card.exonerated {
    opacity: 0.4;
    filter: grayscale(50%);
    border: 1px solid var(--text-muted);
}

.suspect-card.should-exonerate {
    border: 2px solid var(--warning);
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.2);
}
```

### **Responsive Design:**
- **Mobile-first approach** with grid layouts
- **Flexible trait reference** that collapses on small screens  
- **Touch-friendly buttons** (minimum 44px tap targets)
- **Readable typography** across all device sizes

## Critical Functions & Logic

### **Game Initialization:**
```javascript
function generateInitialClues() {
    const numClues = 1;  // NEVER change this value
    // Must randomly select 1 trait type
    // Must ensure logical consistency
}
```

### **Suspect Matching Logic:**
```javascript
function matchesCulpritClues(suspect) {
    // MUST check ALL revealed clues
    // MUST handle edge cases for trait progressions
    // MUST respect difficulty-specific matching rules
}
```

### **Exoneration Validation:**
```javascript
function checkExonerations() {
    // MUST provide specific feedback messages
    // MUST require 100% accuracy for new clues
    // MUST handle both correct and incorrect exonerations
}
```

## Performance & Deployment

### **Bundle Size Targets:**
- **Total:** <50KB uncompressed
- **JavaScript:** ~18KB
- **CSS:** ~12KB  
- **HTML:** ~8KB
- **Load Time:** <2 seconds on 3G

### **Browser Compatibility:**
- **Modern browsers:** Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **NO Internet Explorer support**
- **Progressive enhancement** for older browsers

### **Deployment Configuration:**
```json
// package.json requirements
{
  "name": "guilty-detective-game",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Specific Implementation Rules

### **NEVER DO:**
1. **Remove the un-exonerate functionality** - players must be able to reverse mistakes
2. **Hide exonerated suspects** - they must remain visible but grayed out
3. **Start with more than 1 clue** - this breaks the strategic progression
4. **Allow winning without 3+ rounds** - defeats the logic puzzle purpose
5. **Add timers or pressure mechanics** - this is a thinking game
6. **Change trait progressions** - they are carefully balanced
7. **Use frameworks** - keep it vanilla JavaScript for performance
8. **Embed CSS/JS in HTML** - maintain clean file separation

### **ALWAYS DO:**
1. **Validate perfect elimination rounds** before revealing new clues
2. **Provide specific feedback** on player actions and progress  
3. **Maintain responsive design** across all screen sizes
4. **Test edge cases** in trait matching logic
5. **Preserve game state consistency** throughout the session
6. **Follow the established visual hierarchy** and color system
7. **Keep performance optimized** for mobile devices

## Future Enhancement Guidelines

### **Acceptable Additions:**
- **Statistics tracking** (win rates, average time, rounds)
- **Achievement system** (perfect games, speed solving)
- **Accessibility improvements** (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Animation polish** (smooth transitions, micro-interactions)
- **Additional crime scenarios** (following existing pattern)

### **Architecture Expansions:**
- **Save/load game state** (localStorage)
- **Daily challenge mode** (seeded random generation)
- **Hint system** (limited use, maintains difficulty)
- **Tutorial mode** (guided first game)

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- **Lazy loading** for non-critical elements
- **Service worker** for offline play
- **Image optimization** for crime scenario graphics
- **Bundle splitting** if complexity grows

## Development History & Troubleshooting

### **Critical Fixes Log (January 2024)**

#### **Issue #1: Check Exonerations Button Not Working**
- **Problem:** Button had incorrect enable/disable logic and wasn't validating properly
- **User Guidance:** "The 'check exonerations' button still doesn't work"
- **Root Cause:** Button disabled when `shouldExonerate === 0` but should also check for incorrect exonerations
- **Solution:** 
  ```javascript
  const hasWork = shouldExonerate > 0 || incorrectlyExonerated > 0;
  checkBtn.disabled = !hasWork;
  ```
- **Additional:** Added comprehensive debug logging and better feedback messages

#### **Issue #2: Green Matches in Initial Clues**
- **Problem:** Initial clue could create exact matches, making game too easy
- **User Guidance:** "Change the difficulty so that there are no greens given as the current clue"
- **Root Cause:** Random trait selection didn't consider suspect distribution
- **Solution:** Intelligent clue generation with up to 50 attempts to find traits with no exact matches
- **Code:**
  ```javascript
  const exactMatches = gameState.suspects.filter(suspect => 
      suspect !== gameState.culprit && 
      suspect.traits[selectedTraitType] === gameState.culprit.traits[selectedTraitType]
  ).length;
  if (exactMatches === 0) break; // Perfect clue found
  ```

#### **Issue #3: Inaccurate Tracker Numbers**
- **Problem:** "Should exonerate"/"Exonerated"/"Remaining" counts were wrong
- **User Guidance:** "Make sure the logic is perfect so the number of suspects who should be exonerated in each round is accurate"
- **Root Cause:** Stale suspect status calculations and missing recalculations
- **Solution:** 
  - Always call `updateSuspectStatuses()` before counting
  - Recalculate on every UI update
  - Track incorrect exonerations separately
- **Result:** Perfect real-time accuracy in all tracker displays

#### **Issue #4: Deployment Dependency Issues**
- **Problem:** Express module not found when running locally
- **Context:** `Error: Cannot find module 'express'` in server.js
- **Solution:** Ensure `npm install` runs before `npm start`
- **Prevention:** Added to .gitignore and deployment documentation

#### **Issue #5: Game Stuck State - All Remaining Suspects Match Clues**
- **Problem:** Player reached state where all 4 remaining suspects had "Knowledge: Expert" (exact matches)
- **User Analysis:** "Can you analyze what went wrong here? Was I wrong or is there an issue with the game?"
- **Root Cause:** Initial "no green matches" fix only applied to first clue; subsequent clues could create unsolvable states
- **Impact:** 0 suspects should be exonerated â†’ no way to progress â†’ violates "3+ round minimum" design goal
- **Solution:** Intelligent clue progression that analyzes elimination potential
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  // Find trait that eliminates most suspects while keeping game solvable
  const eliminableCount = remainingSuspects.filter(suspect => {
      if (suspect === gameState.culprit) return false;
      const tempClues = [...gameState.cluesRevealed, { type: traitType, value: culpritValue }];
      return !wouldMatchAllClues(suspect, tempClues);
  }).length;
  ```
- **Prevention:** Each new clue ensures 1+ suspects can be eliminated but game remains solvable

### **User Design Philosophy Enforcement:**

#### **Minimal Starting Information:**
- **Requirement:** "Start with minimal information - just 1 clue"
- **Implementation:** All difficulties now start with exactly 1 clue
- **Rationale:** Forces 3+ round strategic gameplay over lucky guessing

#### **No Green Shortcuts:**
- **Requirement:** "No greens given as the current clue"
- **Implementation:** Intelligent trait selection avoiding exact matches
- **Impact:** Players must use deductive reasoning, not pattern matching

#### **Perfect Logic Validation:**
- **Requirement:** "Make sure the logic is perfect"
- **Implementation:** Comprehensive status recalculation and validation
- **Tools:** Debug logging, real-time tracker updates, specific feedback messages

#### **Strategic Depth Over Speed:**
- **Philosophy:** "Thinking game, not guessing game"
- **Enforcement:** No timer pressure, mistake recovery, clear visual feedback
- **Result:** Game requires systematic analysis over multiple rounds

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Runtime Issues:**
1. **Exoneration button not working** â†’ Check event delegation and status updates
2. **Trait matching errors** â†’ Verify getTraitDistance() edge cases and difficulty logic
3. **UI layout breaks** â†’ Check CSS grid and flexbox fallbacks
4. **Game state corruption** â†’ Validate suspect generation and status updates
5. **Tracker inaccuracy** â†’ Ensure updateSuspectStatuses() called before counting

#### **Deployment Issues:**
1. **Express module missing** â†’ Run `npm install` before `npm start`
2. **Render cache issues** â†’ Force refresh deployment, check commit hashes
3. **Static file serving** â†’ Verify server.js configuration for static assets
